So I subscribed to Adobe's [Photography plan (20GB)](https://www.adobe.com/sea/creativecloud/photography/compare-plans.html) back in February, which costs 9.99 USD per month but I have only used it for like 2-3 weeks but forgot to cancel the subscription within the first 14-days.

And it was renewed once.... Yep, that's my own fault :'(.

Today I somehow remember about it again, and here's what happens:
- I found out that cancelling subscription after the first 14-days will result in a penalty of ["a lump sum amount of 50% of your remaining contract obligation"](https://www.adobe.com/sea/legal/subscription-terms.html). They call it "early cancellation fee". In my case, that's around 45 USD, which is ridiculous.
- Of course I'm not taking any of that bs, so I googled and found out that there is a loophole in the Adobe subscription paradigm
	- You **cannot cancel without extra charge** (mentioned above) after the first 14-days.
	- But they allow you to **switch to a different plan**. They call it "offers".
	- Here's the catch: **switching plan does not cost anything on its own** (you still have to pay for the new plan's subscription fee). So if you switch to a different plan, **your current subscription will be terminated and a new subscription of the new plan will start**, which means that you now can cancel the new subscription and get a full refund, without any additional charge. (within the first 14-days of course)

Note:
- Your current subscription will be terminated immediately, you might get a partial refund for the remaining days of your current subscription if the price of the current plan > the new plan.
- You will be charged for the new subscription, but it will be refunded fully so don't sweat it.
